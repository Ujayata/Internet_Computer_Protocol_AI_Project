# Internet_Computer_Protocol_AI_Project
The use of artificial intelligence is becoming more and more widespread. However, this can lead to some problems. For example, people now prefer to learn by asking questions to chatbots instead of getting information from websites. 
Artificial intelligence companies can use this information from websites as they wish, at no cost. This reduces click-through rates and advertising revenue for websites and puts content producers in a difficult situation. 
Continuing in this way could lead to less data being uploaded to the internet, which could hinder or even halt the development of AI applications.  This continued use of resources also poses a problem for rights ownership and copyrights. On the other hand, as the development of AI depends on the efforts of centralized companies, it is underperforming.  A platform pioneering the 'Teach to Earn' model by using the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) infrastructure and through the ICP network, paying royalties to data provider companies that protect their ownership rights, redesigning the revenue model without the need for website owners to reach the user directly, and contributing to the increase of artificial intelligence of users. 
The platform will accelerate the digital migration from web2 to web3 and increase the number of projects and sites on the ICP, allowing them to attract organic traffic.
It can enable existing projects running on ICP infrastructure to reach a wider audience and accelerate the development of the ecosystem.


Why are we launchIng a project on artIfIcIal IntellIgence?


We chose the field of artificial intelligence because, despite the rapid increase in the use of artificial intelligence projects, there is still a long way to go.  ICP will be thinking like us that they selected the Pyhton Agent Project as the 1st in the Hackathon they organized in China.
